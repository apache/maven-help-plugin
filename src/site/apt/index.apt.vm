${project.name}

 The Maven Help Plugin is used to get relative information about a project or the system. It can be used to get a
 description of a particular plugin, including the plugin's goals with their parameters and component requirements,
 the effective POM and effective settings of the current build, and the profiles applied to the current project being
 built.

* Goals Overview

  The Help Plugin has 8 goals:

  * {{{./active-profiles-mojo.html}help:active-profiles}} lists the profiles which are currently active for the build.

  * {{{./all-profiles-mojo.html}help:all-profiles}} lists the available profiles under the current project.

  * {{{./describe-mojo.html}help:describe}} describes the attributes of a Plugin and/or a Mojo (Maven plain Old Java
  Object).

  * {{{./effective-pom-mojo.html}help:effective-pom}} displays the effective POM as an XML for the current build, with
  the active profiles factored in. If <<<verbose>>>, a comment is added to each XML element describing the origin of the line.

  * {{{./effective-settings-mojo.html}help:effective-settings}} displays the calculated settings as an XML for the
  project, given any profile enhancement and the inheritance of the global settings into the user-level settings.

  * {{{./evaluate-mojo.html}help:evaluate}} evaluates Maven expressions given by the user in an interactive mode.

  * {{{./help-mojo.html}help:help}} Display help information for the maven-help-plugin itself.

  * {{{./system-mojo.html}help:system}} displays a list of the platform details like system properties and environment
  variables.
  
  []

* Major Version Upgrade to version 3.0.0

  Please note that the goal <<<expressions>>> has been completely removed from the plugin. All the Maven expressions
  that are supported as plugin parameters are available in the Javadoc of the
  {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/PluginParameterExpressionEvaluator.html}
  <<<PluginParameterExpressionEvaluator>>>}} class.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Help Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please feel free to contact the
  {{{./mailing-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mailing-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-management.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./scm.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
